# The Day Plan System

I don't have a good name for this because it's mostly intended for my personal use, but I've explained it to enough people by now that I wanted to write it up.
I just refer to it as "the day plan system".

Basic idea is this:

1. Take an index card. Write the current date on it.
2. Write down a bunch of stuff I *could* do today. This is not a commitment that I *will* do it, and in general I deliberately put too much stuff on it.
3. The things I write down tend to be a mix of easy and hard stuff, and the list grows throughout the day.
4. As I complete things, cross it off.
5. At the end of the day mount it on my corkboard in a stack of completed day plans as a trophy.
6. Add the number of crossed off items on the day plan to to my dayplan [beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/home) goal.

The idea of the system is that whenever I find myself casting around for something to do, staring into space, procrastinating, etc. the day plan system gives me something to latch on to.
It also helps me break things down. It's essentially an assistive tool, especially on days where I have high anxiety or poor executive function.

The key design goals in the day plan system are:

1. The day plan is *not a commitment to anything*. It is a tool to help me manage what I am doing.
2. The day plan must never be a source of stress. It is a tool to *reduce* stress.
3. The beeminder goal is purely there to keep me using the system. It's not a commitment to be productive.
4. Using the day plan should make me feel good in a way that encourages me to tackle bigger items on it.

I've been finding it extremely helpful. It frequently results in days where I would otherwise have not got anything done turning into fairly productive days working through routine tasks,
because it forces me to think ask "what *could* I do today?" and "is there anything I could productively be doing right now?".
