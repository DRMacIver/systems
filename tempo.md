# Tempo

Tempo (working title) is a way of structuring a conversation that allows you to cover a wide range of interesting subjects in a short amount of time,
in a way that tries to ensure everyone gets a chance to share their thoughts.
Tempo structures the conversation into a series of small time boxes, with a mixed mechanism designed to keep the conversation on topics that are interesting to the group.

Tempo is explicitly designed so that a group that can vary throughout the course of the conversation as people drop in and out, and so the group can be split if it gets too large.

## Background

Tempo started out as a fork of lean coffee, adapted to deal with my frustrations with the basic design of the system.
It's *very much* still a work in progress.
I ran a couple sessions of [variant lean coffee at PyCon UK](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-09-20-09:17.html),
and Tempo is the next generation system based on that.

The name is stolen from [a web toy](https://drmaciver.github.io/tempo/) I created after that session, but I now think the web toy is a bad idea and a human time keeper is better.

The system as I describe in this document has yet to be play tested and will likely be modified in the course of play testing.

## Setup and Equipment

Tempo requires two people: A time keeper, and a scribe. The time keeper is responsible for keeping the flow of conversation moving and enforcing the rules,
the scribe is responsible for taking notes. It is very strongly recommended that these not be the same person.
Both should feel free to take part in the conversation themselves, though if the time keeper talks a lot it may be worth having a second time keeper to check on them.

The time keeper needs a stop watch of some sort (phone app is fine, though personally I use an old school digital watch).
They also need a deck of blank cards (index cards are fine, but something playing card sized is better because they're easier to shuffle)

The scribe should probably be taking notes on a laptop, but it's up to them.

Every person should have pen and paper in front of them to take notes on and write down the topics they want to discuss.

Each person should write down their name on a card and hand it to the time keeper, who shuffles these cards.
They then each take up to five minutes to write down topics they want to discuss.
Play begins when either everyone agrees they are done or those five minutes have elapsed.

Optional: A collection of black and white stones to use for voting. You can use show-of-hands if you don't have these.

## Running a round

1. If the deck of names is empty, the time keeper shuffles the discard pile and makes it the new deck.
2. The time keeper draws a random person's name from the top of the deck and and puts it in the discard pile.
3. That person now picks the topic they've previously written down that they most want to discuss, and has 30 seconds to pitch it to the group - read out the prompt and elaborate on it.
4. At this point, anyone may choose to veto discussion on the topic. Reasons to veto can be essentially anything, but should not be used lightly - ideally a veto would only be performed if the conversation topic would be actively unpleasant for you in some way - e.g. triggery. People are not required to explain their vetoes, but people who use their veto a lot may be asked to elaborate and/or politely asked to leave the group.
5. The group now votes with a show of hands (or other mechanism). People should vote yes if they *actively want* to discuss the topic *and* don't feel that it is too similar to anything that has already been discussed. If a *strict* majority (that is, more than 50% of the group) wants to discuss the topic, they now have five minutes to do so.
6. The five minute discussion is mostly unstructured, but if anyone is talking for more than 5-10 seconds (the time keeper should use judgement here - people who are talking a lot should be held to 5 seconds, people who haven't talked recently have the full 10), they should be interrupted and other people should be allowed to speak. Once someone is interrupted, they now shouldn't talk until someone else has had a chance to (and ideally several someone elses).
7. Once the five minutes have elapsed, the group votes again as to whether they want to continue talking about this subject for another five minutes. If yes, they continue as before. If no, the round ends. There is no option to extend the round a second time.
8. Everyone has some time to silently write down any notes they want or new ideas for conversation topics. The next round begins when everyone is done.

## The Interrupt Protocol

The time keeper's main job is to interrupt people when they hit a time limit.
When someone needs to stop talking, the time keeper (or anyone else who is tracking time if the time keeper is the one speaking or has otherwise dropped the ball) should start waving at them.
They now should finish their sentence and stop.
If they take longer than a second or two to do this, the time keeper should verbally interrupt them.

## Joining Midway Through

It is easy to join a tempo session midway through.
Pull up a chair, get a pad of paper, write down at least one conversation topic you want to discuss, and add a card with your name on it to the deck (The time keeper should shuffle the deck before the next round starts if new cards have been added).

People are welcome to listen in if they are not in the deck, but they should not participate in the conversation.

## Splitting the group

The optimal size for a tempo session is probably about 5-8 people.
Once you've hit ten or more people, it's time to split the group (feel free to experiment with this number).

To do this, add the discard pile back into the deck, shuffle the deck, and deal out two new smaller decks of roughly equal size.
Those are your two new groups. Find appropriate table space to separate, and resume as normal.

## Ending the Session

Unlike lean coffee, there is no predefined set of cards that people work through, so there is no well defined end to the session. Equally, because people can leave at any point, there's no real difficulty in it continuing indefinitely except that the time keeper and scribe will be exhausted.
As a result there is no real set ending rule, but the session can be ended after any round, and it's generally useful for scheduling purposes to set a rough end time up front.
